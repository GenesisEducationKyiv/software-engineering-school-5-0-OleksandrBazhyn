## Context
The application requires a reliable source of weather data to provide users with accurate and timely weather updates. The choice of weather data source is critical to ensure the application's functionality and user satisfaction.

## Decision
I have decided to use the Weather API as the primary source for weather data. This decision is based on the following criteria:

1. **Data Accuracy**: Weather is known for its reliable and accurate weather data, which is essential for our application's credibility.
2. **Coverage**: The API provides global coverage, allowing users to get weather information for cities around the world.
3. **Ease of Use**: The API is well-documented and easy to integrate, which will speed up the development process.
4. **Cost**: Weather API offers a free tier that meets our initial needs, allowing us to minimize costs during the early stages of development.
5. **Additional Features**: The API provides various endpoints, including current weather, forecasts, and historical data, which can enhance the application's functionality in the future.
6. **Endpoint Availability**: It is important to note that free tiers of weather APIs often provide access to less reliable endpoints or servers, which may result in higher rates of temporary unavailability or errors. This can affect the stability of the service, so additional error handling and fallback strategies should be considered.

## Consequences
By choosing Weather API, we ensure that our application can deliver accurate weather information to users. However, we must also consider the following:

- **Rate Limiting**: We need to implement caching and efficient data fetching strategies to avoid hitting the API's rate limits, especially as the user base grows.
- **Dependency on External Service**: Relying on an external API means we must handle potential downtimes or changes in the API's terms of service.
- **Endpoint Reliability**: Since free tiers may have lower availability, we should monitor error rates and be prepared to upgrade to a paid plan or switch providers if service interruptions become frequent.

This decision will be revisited if the project's requirements change or if we encounter significant issues with the chosen data source.
